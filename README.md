The Guides Grand Adventure is a simple android java game inspired by the old 8-bit platform style of games. The project was mainly done in eclipse, with some outside programs such as Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop used for asset creation and development. The files can easily be imported as an android studio project from this repository, instructions will be listed below. Various assets in the game were sourced from the public, the credits are listed in the credits section.

## Motivation

At the start of the semester we (RR Int.) had a debate on what would motivate us the most to create, and the consensus was a video game! Making games are fun, challenging, and rewarding to create, as well as play, so the choice was a win/win on both fronts. Throughout the process of creating many aspects of the project we learned a lot of valuable lessions about teamwork and java/android programming that will serve us well in future classes and in the carreers we pursue. The game also gave us a chance to demonstrate the creative side of our team, as many of the image files were created by the team, barring some site logos that were included for crediting. In short, this project exists as a demonstration of the lessons we (RR Int.) learned and how we can implement and apply them to a stand-alone android app program.
